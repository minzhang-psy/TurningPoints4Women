# TurningPoints4Women
The Turning Points Study builds on an existing longitudinal study to further our understanding of the trajectories of women’s justice involvement across adolescence and adulthood. It is one of the longest ongoing studies examining women’s involvement in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems. Our team will focus on understanding trajectories of trauma exposure and its sequalae, in order to identify salient points for prevention and intervention efforts. Another key goal of the project is to understand whether Treatment Foster Care Oregon (TFCO) delivered during adolescence has long-term benefits for women’s physiological health, as measured through an index of allostatic load.
